# NOAA Fisheries Memo to Record

This is a template for a NOAA Fisheries Memo to Record in Quarto. To generate a new Memo to Record Quarto file, run this in your terminal:
 
```bash
quarto use template rfortherestofus/noaa-fisheries-memo-to-record
```
This will install the extension and create an example Quarto file that you can use as a starting place for your memo.

You can render your Quarto file, which will create a Word document that you can then edit as you see fit.
